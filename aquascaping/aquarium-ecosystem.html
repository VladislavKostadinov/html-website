    <p>Seven years ago I developed a hobby - it was aquascaping. Eventhough I had very little
        experiece and I was afraid I would create a water crisis for my new apartment 
        colorful inhabitants, I still decided to give it a try. The results was a beautiful
        ecosystem, which evolved and continues to evolve with time.
