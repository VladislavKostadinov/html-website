    <h1>At the beginning...</h1>
    <img src="../../images/aquascaping/theverystart1.jpg" alt="aquarium with no vegetation">
    <p>At first there was very little vegetation and no fish. I needed to create the ecosystem 
        first, so the fish would feel at home. It was hard and I had no skills, so I wondered
        what would come out of it all. Still, I put in some effort an stubborness and waited 
        to see the result.
