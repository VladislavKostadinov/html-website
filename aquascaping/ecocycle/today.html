    <p>My ecosystem survived and required less effort to maintain, now that is has 
        stablized itself. Still, I think I need to pay it more attention. The inhabitants 
        seem happy and that is my main drive. When I watch them I marvel at the beauty of 
        these creatures and feel pleasant emotions. They sometime motivate me to give my best, 
        when there are obstacles ahead. I plan on some increased maintenance soon.
