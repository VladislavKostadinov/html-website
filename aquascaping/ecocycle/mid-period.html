    <h1>Mid period</h1>
    <img src="../../images/aquascaping/begging2.jpg" alt="aquarium with blooming vegetation">
    <p>A couple of years have passed and I had new "roomates". They tend to make me feel 
        calm and happy, when I watch them swin arround in harmony, or jump playfully into the
        air, before submergin into the water again. My friends are friendly to one another and 
        accept new inhabitants with hospitality. There are some shrimps as well, and also some 
        fresh-water snails. The vegetation is growing fine, some plants dissapear only to 
        immerge once again from the dirt in unexpected place. I suspect that underground 
        they have developed a network of roots.
