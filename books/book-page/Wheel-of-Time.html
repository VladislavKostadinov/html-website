    <p>Wheel of time is a fantasy saga, written by Robert Jordan and is a bestseller. I 
        grew up with his books and am deeply connected with the story. It describes a fantasy
        world where magic is divided to male and female Force, and is rich with prophecies, 
        monsters, castles and adventures. The thing that makes it unique to me is the way the
        story is told, and also the charecters themselves - each of them with an unique story 
        and background, and personality you either like to grow to like in time. It is a long 
        saga, with more than 13 large books.
