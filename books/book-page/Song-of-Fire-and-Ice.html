    <p>Song of Fire and Ice by J. R. R. Martin is a bestseller which got its very own tv 
        series spin-off, which grew in popularity. Many of the fans know about the story from
        the tv series, still I loved it even before HBO aired it, and was thrilled that it got
        its own visual adaptation. The books are awesome and combine realism with fantasy in a 
        unique way I find interesting. Charecters and events are unpredictable, heroes rise and 
        fall, dragons soar through the skies. I grew affinity to it in a way, I would rather 
        keep to myself, but I do appreciate the author's great contribution to the 
        fantasy genre.
