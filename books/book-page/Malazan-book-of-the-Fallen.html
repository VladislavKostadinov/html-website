    <h1>Malazan Book of the Fallen</h1>
    <img src="../../images/books/malazanbookofthefallen.jpg" alt="book cover">
    <p>Malazan Book of the Fallen by Stephen Erickson is another example of a unique fantasy 
        saga. The story is rich, with different races, unctrollable magic, strange beings and 
        drama. The world is huge and most of the time you do not understand what exactly is 
        happening at the exact moment, but when you realise it sooner or later, you feel the 
        power of the book. The novels are difficult to read and grasp, you have to 
        concentrate if you are to understand everything (or most of it), but it is worth it. 
        The books and individual stories are close to my heart and are easily in my top 3 of 
        fantasy novels.
