    <h1>Warcraft 3</h1>
    <img src="../../images/games/warcraft.jpg">
    <p>Warcraft is a game, I used to play a lot in my childhood and teenage years. One thing
        about it that entices me is its lore and storyline. I really like the fantasy 
        enviroment and the detail to each and every aspect. It has the ability to involve you
        in its unique fantasy world and grab your attention to the fullest. Many of my personal
        projects are influenced by it. I won't bother you will technical details, but it is a
        fantasy strategy game with rich storyline and atmosphere. I real classic! (It has 
        awesome soundtrack too!)
