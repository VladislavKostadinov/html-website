    <h1>Diablo 2</h1>
    <img src="../../images/games/diablo.jpg">
    <p>With its dark atmosphere and unique soundtrack, this game is one of my favourites. 
        It is a RPG game, you go arround killing bad guys (demons and monsters) and collecting
        valueble items, you finish quests and get stronger with time. Bosses are awesome and
        scary and the lore is rich and interesting. It is a classic and some of my personal 
        projects are influenced by its unique concept.
