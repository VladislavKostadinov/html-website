    <p>What can be said about League of Legends (or LoL in short). I spent nearly 10 years of 
        my life playing this addictive game. It is a Moba, or in other words you take control
        of a certain character and join a team of other real life players to combat against the
        enemy team. The better you are, the stronger you get, but there is always the element of
        team-work, so nothing is certain until the end. It is highly addictive and so much fun,
        with its bright effects and well-designed hero skills. I actually quit, because it is 
        very time and energy-consuming.
