    <p>Shelter is a long-time dream of mine. It is a forum in the form of a game, where you 
        participate by writing fantasy fiction with your charecter in a fantasy world, which 
        I created. The first game was more than 15 years ago, but was created on a free template. 
        It turned out to be very interesting and popular, so now...with my new skill set, I 
        decided to try and recreate it, and launch it once again. The project is not finished 
        yet, and is hard, but I put so much effort and desire, that I really hope that it will 
        air soon!
