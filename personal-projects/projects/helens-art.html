    <p>My cousin likes to draw pictures and asked me if I can make a simple web site, where 
        she can display her art and poetry. So I decided to give it a try. The result was a 
        simple web site in the form of a gallery, with options to read her poetry too, and 
        contact her with any questions, related to her work. It is my first personal website.
